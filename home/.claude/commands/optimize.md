# Optimize

## Performance analysis and optimization recommendations

1. Analyze the code, algorithm, or system specified in #$ARGUMENTS
2. Identify performance bottlenecks through careful examination or profiling
3. Consider time complexity, space complexity, and resource utilization
4. Suggest three specific, actionable optimizations with:
   - Clear explanation of the current issue
   - Detailed implementation approach
   - Expected performance improvement
5. Prioritize optimizations by impact and implementation difficulty
6. Include code examples where appropriate
